# Concert Ticketing System â€“ CST1110 Project

This Racket program implements a concert ticketing system for Bands and Fans.

- **Bands** can create, edit, and delete concert listings.
- **Fans** can search concerts, bookmark events, and manage their selections.

The system uses structured data, list processing, and a finite state machine to manage state transitions.

## How to Run

Open the file in **DrRacket** or any Racket-compatible environment and click **Run**.
